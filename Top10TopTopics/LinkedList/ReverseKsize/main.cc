Given a linked list, write a function to reverse every k nodes (where k is an input to the function).If a linked list is given as 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->NULL and k = 3 then output will be 3->2->1->6->5->4->8->7->NULL.

Input:
In this problem, method takes two argument: the head of the linked list and int k. You should not read any input from stdin/console.
The struct Node has a data part which stores the data and a next pointer which points to the next element of the linked list. 
There are multiple test cases. For each test case, this method will be called individually.

Output:
Reverse the linked list in the group of given size and return the reference of starting node(head) of the reversed Linked list .

Note: If you use "Test" or "Expected Output Button" use below example format
Example:
Input:
1
8
1 2 2 4 5 6 7 8
4

Output:
4 2 2 1 8 7 6 5

**For More Examples Use Expected Output**
